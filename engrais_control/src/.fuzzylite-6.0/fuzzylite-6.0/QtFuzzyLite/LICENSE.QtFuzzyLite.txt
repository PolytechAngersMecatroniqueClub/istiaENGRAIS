End User License Agreement

This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you
(either an individual or a single entity) and FuzzyLite Limited with regard to
the copyrighted Software (herein referred to as "QtFuzzyLite Application" or

terms are provided by the software supplier, in which case certain additional
or different terms may apply. If you do not agree with the terms of this EULA,
do not download, install, copy or use the Software. By installing, copying or
otherwise using the QtFuzzyLite Application, you agree to be bound by the terms
of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, FuzzyLite Limited
is unwilling to license the QtFuzzyLite Application to you.

and non-exclusive right to use the copy of the Software provided with this
EULA. You agree you will not copy the Software except as necessary to use it on
a single computer. You agree that you may not copy the written materials
accompanying the Software. Modifying, translating, renting, copying,
transferring or assigning all or part of the Software, or any rights granted
hereunder, to any other persons and removing any proprietary notices, labels or

not to create derivative works based on the Software. You may not transfer this
Software.

4. Reverse Engineering. You agree that you will not attempt, and if you are a
corporation, you will use your best efforts to prevent your employees and
contractors from attempting to reverse compile, modify, translate or
disassemble the Software in whole or in part. Any failure to comply with the
above or any other terms and conditions contained herein will result in the
automatic termination of this license and the reversion of the rights granted
hereunder to FuzzyLite Limited.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty. The Software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of
any kind. FuzzyLite Limited disclaims and makes no express or implied

6. Limitation of Liability. FuzzyLite Limited's entire liability and your
exclusive remedy under this EULA shall not exceed the price paid for the

consequential, special, incidental or indirect damages of any kind arising out
of the use or inability to use the software, even if FuzzyLite Limited has been
advised of the possibility of such damages, or any claim by a third party.

7. Rental. You may not loan, rent, or lease the SOFTWARE.

8. Upgrades. If the SOFTWARE is an upgrade from an earlier release or
previously released version, you now may use that upgraded product only in
accordance with this EULA. If the QtFuzzyLite Application is an upgrade of a

incidental, direct, indirect special and consequential damages, damages for
loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information,
or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use or inability to use this
QtFuzzyLite Application, even if FuzzyLite Limited has been advised of the
possibility of such damages. Because some states/countries do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
the above limitation may not apply to you.

Agreement, you agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend FuzzyLite Limited
from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees that arise
