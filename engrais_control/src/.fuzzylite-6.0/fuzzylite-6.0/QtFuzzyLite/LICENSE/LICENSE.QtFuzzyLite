computer software, the associated media, any printed materials, and any
"online" or electronic documentation. Use of any software and related
documentation ("Software") provided to you by FuzzyLite Limited in whatever
form or media, will constitute your acceptance of these terms, unless separate
terms are provided by the software supplier, in which case certain additional
or different terms may apply. If you do not agree with the terms of this EULA,
do not download, install, copy or use the Software. By installing, copying or
otherwise using the QtFuzzyLite Application, you agree to be bound by the terms
of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, FuzzyLite Limited
is unwilling to license the QtFuzzyLite Application to you.

1. Eligible Licensees. This Software is available for license solely to

licensing, or sub-licensing. IF YOU DO NOT OWN THE SOFTWARE, THEN DO NOT
DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

2. License Grant. FuzzyLite Limited grants to you a personal, non-transferable
and non-exclusive right to use the copy of the Software provided with this
EULA. You agree you will not copy the Software except as necessary to use it on
a single computer. You agree that you may not copy the written materials
accompanying the Software. Modifying, translating, renting, copying,
transferring or assigning all or part of the Software, or any rights granted
hereunder, to any other persons and removing any proprietary notices, labels or
marks from the Software is strictly prohibited. Furthermore, you hereby agree
not to create derivative works based on the Software. You may not transfer this
Software.

3. Copyright. The Software is licensed, not sold. You acknowledge that no title
to the intellectual property in the Software is transferred to you. You further
acknowledge that title and full ownership rights to the Software will remain
the exclusive property of FuzzyLite Limited, and you will not acquire any
rights to the Software, except as expressly set forth above. All copies of the

Application), the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the
QtFuzzyLite Application, are owned by FuzzyLite Limited. The QtFuzzyLite
Application is protected by copyright laws and international treaty provisions.
You may not copy the printed materials accompanying the QtFuzzyLite Application.

4. Reverse Engineering. You agree that you will not attempt, and if you are a
corporation, you will use your best efforts to prevent your employees and
contractors from attempting to reverse compile, modify, translate or
disassemble the Software in whole or in part. Any failure to comply with the
above or any other terms and conditions contained herein will result in the
automatic termination of this license and the reversion of the rights granted
hereunder to FuzzyLite Limited.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty. The Software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of
any kind. FuzzyLite Limited disclaims and makes no express or implied
warranties and specifically disclaims the warranties of merchantability,

consequential, special, incidental or indirect damages of any kind arising out
of the use or inability to use the software, even if FuzzyLite Limited has been
advised of the possibility of such damages, or any claim by a third party.

7. Rental. You may not loan, rent, or lease the SOFTWARE.

8. Upgrades. If the SOFTWARE is an upgrade from an earlier release or
previously released version, you now may use that upgraded product only in
accordance with this EULA. If the QtFuzzyLite Application is an upgrade of a

Application may be used only as part of that single product package and may not
be separated for use on more than one computer.

loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information,
or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use or inability to use this
QtFuzzyLite Application, even if FuzzyLite Limited has been advised of the
possibility of such damages. Because some states/countries do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
the above limitation may not apply to you.

Agreement, you agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend FuzzyLite Limited
from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees that arise
or result from the use or distribution of the Software in violation of this
